# Password Length Fix - 72 Byte Bcrypt Limitation

## Problem
The backend was returning a **500 Internal Server Error** when users tried to sign up or log in with passwords:

```json
{
  "detail": "Signup failed: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes, truncate manually if necessary (e.g. my_password[:72])"
}
```

Additionally, the Swagger documentation endpoint was returning a 500 error for the same reason.

## Root Cause
Two issues were identified:

1. **Original Issue**: Bcrypt has a 72-byte limitation for passwords. The original code was **rejecting** passwords that exceeded this limit instead of handling them gracefully.

2. **Secondary Issue**: The system was using an incompatible version combination:
   - `bcrypt==5.0.0` (broken with passlib)
   - `passlib==1.7.4`
   
   This combination caused bcrypt to fail even for normal passwords due to a version compatibility issue.

## Solution

### Part 1: Password Truncation Logic
Instead of rejecting long passwords, the backend now **automatically truncates** passwords to 72 bytes before hashing them. This approach:

1. **Allows users with longer passwords to sign up successfully**
2. **Maintains security** - passwords are safely truncated before hashing
3. **Ensures login works correctly** - login also truncates passwords the same way during verification
4. **Provides debug logging** - console logs indicate when password truncation occurs

### Part 2: Bcrypt Version Fix
Downgraded bcrypt from 5.0.0 to 4.1.2 for compatibility with passlib:

```bash
pip install bcrypt==4.1.2
```

This ensures both signup and login work properly with bcrypt password hashing.

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/routes/auth_routes.py`

#### 1. Updated Password Validation (Lines 21-29)
**Removed** the 72-byte limit check from the Pydantic validator:
- Before: Rejected passwords > 72 bytes with a ValueError
- After: Only checks that password is not empty and is at least 6 characters

#### 2. Signup Handler (Lines 62-111)
Added password truncation logic:
```python
# Truncate password to 72 bytes (bcrypt limitation)
password_bytes = user.password.encode('utf-8')
if len(password_bytes) > 72:
    print(f"[SIGNUP DEBUG] Password exceeds 72 bytes, truncating from {len(password_bytes)} to 72 bytes")
    truncated_password = password_bytes[:72].decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
else:
    truncated_password = user.password

hashed_pw = pwd_context.hash(truncated_password)
```

#### 3. Login Handler (Lines 114-157)
Added the same password truncation logic during login verification.

### Pip Dependency Fix
Downgraded bcrypt version to ensure compatibility:
```bash
pip install bcrypt==4.1.2
```

## Verification Results

After the fix, all tests passed:

✅ **Signup Tests:**
- Normal password (12 chars): SUCCESS - User ID created
- Long password (100 chars): SUCCESS - User ID created (truncated to 72 bytes)

✅ **Login Tests:**
- Login with normal password: SUCCESS - Access token received
- Login with long password: SUCCESS - Access token received

✅ **API Endpoints:**
- Swagger `/docs`: Working (Status 200)
- OpenAPI JSON: Working (Status 200)
- Health check `/`: Working (Status 200)

## How It Works

### Signup Flow
1. User enters a password (can be any length)
2. Password is validated for minimum length (6 chars) - no maximum check
3. Password is encoded to UTF-8 bytes
4. If > 72 bytes, password is truncated to first 72 bytes
5. Truncated password is hashed with bcrypt
6. Hash is stored in database

### Login Flow
1. User enters their password
2. Password is encoded to UTF-8 bytes
3. If > 72 bytes, password is truncated to first 72 bytes (same way as signup)
4. Truncated password is verified against stored hash
5. Login succeeds if verification passes

## Important Notes

- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Passwords are truncated at the byte level after UTF-8 encoding. Special characters (emojis, accents, etc.) may take multiple bytes.
- **Error Handling**: The truncation uses `errors='ignore'` when decoding to safely handle UTF-8 boundary cases.
- **Debug Logging**: Debug messages are logged when truncation occurs for production troubleshooting.
- **Bcrypt Version**: Use `bcrypt==4.1.2` for compatibility with `passlib==1.7.4`

## Testing

To test the fix in your browser:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Try signing up with a long password (100+ characters)
3. Should receive "Account created successfully" message
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
5. Should be able to log in with the same password
