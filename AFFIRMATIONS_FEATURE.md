## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. **`frontend/pages/affirmations.tsx`**
   - Main affirmations page component
   - Uses React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`
   - Responsive CSS styling with animations

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/components/BottomNav.tsx`**

   - Updated icon to worship hands SVG
   - Path changed from `/settings` to `/affirmations`

2. **`frontend/styles/globals.css`**

   - Added `--color-bg-secondary` CSS variable for dark mode: `#17253A`

## Code Structure

### State Management
- `affirmation`: Current displayed affirmation text
- `usedIndices`: Array tracking which affirmations have been shown
- `router`: For navigation and authentication checks

### Key Functions
- `displayNewAffirmation()`: 
  - Selects random affirmation from unused list
  - Tracks used affirmations
  - Resets when all have been shown
  - Wrapped in `useCallback` for memoization

### Animations
- **fadeIn**: Smooth fade-in effect for affirmation text display
- **pulse**: Subtle pulsing animation on the worship hands emoji
- **hover effects**: Button elevates on mouse hover with enhanced shadow

## Theme Support
- **Light Mode**: Teal/green accent colors with white background
- **Dark Mode**: Uses CSS variables for proper dark theme support
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing app design patterns

## User Flow
1. User clicks "Affirmations" in bottom navigation
2. Page loads with first random affirmation (if logged in)
3. Affirmation displays in centered card with worship hands emoji
4. User reads and reflects on the affirmation
5. User clicks "New Affirmation" button to get another
6. Process repeats with no duplicates until all 30 are shown
7. Back button navigates to dashboard

## Settings Page
**Note**: The Settings functionality has been moved to its original page at `/settings` but is no longer accessible via bottom navigation. Users can still navigate directly to settings if needed, or this can be accessed through a hamburger menu if implemented.

## Future Enhancements
