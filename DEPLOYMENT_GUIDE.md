# Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- All environment variables configured in production
- MongoDB Atlas cluster setup with production database
- IP whitelist configured for production server only
- SSL/TLS certificate configured
- Backups enabled in MongoDB Atlas
- Monitoring and alerts set up

## Production Environment Variables

Set these in your production environment (NOT in code):

\\\
MONGODB_URI=<your_production_mongodb_uri>
SECRET_KEY=<your_strong_jwt_secret>
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
DEBUG=false
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
\\\

## Deployment Steps

1. Update Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run Tests: pytest
3. Build/Package: Containerize with Docker if needed
4. Deploy to your hosting platform
5. Test all endpoints in production

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS only
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up CORS properly for frontend domain
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Regularly rotate database credentials

## Monitoring

- Monitor application logs
- Track API response times
- Monitor database query performance
- Alert on authentication failures
